# Mentor vs Coach vs Manager: What’s the Difference?

Many professionals confuse mentors, coaches, and managers. While all three support growth, their roles are very different.

Understanding these differences helps you choose the right kind of guidance for your career.

## What Is a Manager?

A manager:

- Oversees your work
- Assigns tasks
- Evaluates performance
- Focuses on organisational goals

Managers are responsible for results, not personal career direction.

## What Is a Coach?

A coach:

- Works on specific skills
- Focuses on short-term improvement
- Often follows a structured program
- Is usually paid for outcomes

Coaching is ideal when you want to improve one specific skill.

## What Is a Mentor?

A mentor:

- Shares experience and perspective
- Guides long-term career growth
- Acts as a sounding board
- Supports decision-making

Mentorship is relationship-based, not task-based.

## Which One Do You Need?

Ask yourself:

- Need performance feedback at work? → Manager
- Need skill improvement? → Coach
- Need career clarity and guidance? → Mentor

Many professionals benefit from all three at different stages.

## Why Mentorship Is Unique

Mentorship offers:

- Long-term perspective
- Real-world insight
- Emotional support during transitions
- Honest, unbiased advice

This is why mentorship plays a crucial role in sustainable career growth.
