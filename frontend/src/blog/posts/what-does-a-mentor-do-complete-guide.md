# What Does a Mentor Do? A Complete Guide for Professionals

A mentor can help you grow faster, make better decisions, and avoid mistakes you don’t need to learn the hard way.

But mentoring only works when expectations are clear: what a mentor *does*, what they *don’t* do, and how you (the mentee) show up.

## What a mentor does

A good mentor typically helps with:

### 1) Clarity and direction

- Turning vague frustration into a clear goal
- Helping you compare options (stay, move, pivot, specialise)
- Stress-testing decisions with real-world context

### 2) Feedback based on experience

- Reviewing your CV/LinkedIn and positioning
- Identifying gaps in your skill set
- Offering patterns they’ve seen work (and fail)

### 3) Practical guidance and strategy

- Interview strategy (especially role/level-specific)
- Career progression plans
- Handling stakeholders, confidence, communication, leadership

### 4) Accountability and momentum

- Helping you commit to next steps
- Checking progress and unblocking issues
- Keeping you consistent when motivation dips

## What a mentor is *not*

Mentoring is powerful, but it’s not everything.

A mentor is not:

- **A manager** (they don’t assign your work or promote you)
- **A therapist** (they can support you, but not treat mental health issues)
- **A recruiter** (they may give hiring insight, but they don’t owe referrals)
- **A teacher/trainer** (they may explain concepts, but mentoring isn’t a full course)

When you expect mentoring to replace one of these roles, the relationship usually breaks down.

## Mentor vs coach vs manager (quick comparison)

- **Mentor:** guidance from lived experience, often long-term, informal or structured
- **Coach:** goal-focused performance improvement, often paid, uses frameworks/questions
- **Manager:** accountable for your work output inside an organisation

Some people can be more than one — but the *hat they’re wearing* should be explicit.

## What a mentoring session looks like

Most sessions work best when you bring one clear topic, for example:

- “I’m stuck between two job offers — how should I evaluate them?”
- “I’m not getting interviews. What’s wrong with my positioning?”
- “My manager says I need more ‘leadership’ — what does that mean in practice?”

A useful structure is:

1. Context (2–3 minutes)
2. The decision/problem (what you need help with)
3. Options and trade-offs
4. A plan (next actions)

## How often should you meet a mentor?

It depends on your goal and pace:

- **Every 2 weeks**: good for job search, career transitions, building new habits
- **Monthly**: good for ongoing career growth and guidance

Consistency matters more than frequency.

## How to choose a mentor (fit checklist)

Look for:

- Relevant experience (role/level/industry)
- A feedback style you can handle (direct vs gentle)
- Availability for a consistent cadence
- A willingness to ask questions and challenge you
